# All Google Fonts (TTF files only!);

There is a official Github repo for all Google fonts located at: [https://github.com/google/fonts](https://github.com/google/fonts).
However, all the fonts are in separate folders with license info etc. :( This is a serious pain if you just want to drag all the .ttf files at once to include on your computer. This makes it easy as all .ttf files are inside the same /fonts folder. Just download this repo as zip, unzip (extract) and copy and paste all the fonts to the desired location on your computer. For Mac copy the files to `/Volumes/Macintosh_HD/Library/Fonts/` in windows fonts go in `C:\Users\[Your Name]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Fonts`.

Please note these are the TTF files only! They are used as computer system fonts and for print design. I did not include here the complete set of web fonts formats such as WOFF or WOFF2. Those are easy to use online via free libraries and accessible using https://fonts.google.com/. The purpose of sharing the TTF files is if you are a graphic designer and you want to design layouts that web developers can also use the same web font versions of on a live website. Or if you just really like the Google fonts and want to use them in print design.

## Disclaimer

I DO NOT OWN THESE FONTS! If you want to know the licensing details for each font please refer to https://fonts.google.com or the official Google Github repo linked above.
