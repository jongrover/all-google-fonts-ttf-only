# All Google Fonts (TTF files only!);

There is a official Github repo for all Google fonts located at: [https://github.com/google/fonts](https://github.com/google/fonts).
However, all the fonts are in separate folders with license info etc. :( This is a serious pain if you just want to drag all the .ttf files at once to include on your computer. This makes it easy as all .ttf files are inside the same /fonts folder. Just download this repo as zip, unzip (extract) and copy and paste all the fonts to the desired location on your computer. For Mac copy the files to `/Volumes/Macintosh_HD/Library/Fonts/` in windows fonts go in `C:\Users\[Your Name]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Fonts`.

## Disclaimer

I DO NOT OWN THESE FONTS! If you want to know the licensing details for each font please refer to the google.fonts.com or the official Google Github repo linked above.
